                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>Bountiful Foods was established in 1989 by Freidgrik McGoth. Freidgrik was born on a farm in Montana.
                    His father was a teacher at a grade school, so in order to help his father pay the bills he would 
                    sell the fresh produce at the local market. The year 1989 Freidgrik's dad lost his job, so he and
                    his brother would go to each of their neighbors and for any of the elderly who couldn't, they
                    would take and sell it for them. He and his brother also started advertising their fresh produce
                    online and they established Bountiful Foods.
